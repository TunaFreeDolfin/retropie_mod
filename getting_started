These files are the changes that I have made while setting up RetroPie v3.
When setting up a new instance, the following changes need to be made:

0) Assuming you're starting totally fresh, change the default password or setup ssh certs.
1) Image SD care with new RetroPie version. Pull down contents of this repo.
2) Copy all files to the appropriate location based on where they are located in the repo (TODO: look into creating deb package)
3) Modify /etc/network/interfaces to specify the static IP and router IP
4) Update /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf with the network SSID and PSK
5) Update /etc/fstab with the host of the rom files
6) Create a new .smbcredentials file in /home/pi
7) Update raspi-config:
    - Expand filesystem
    - Update internationalization options
    - Overclock to Pi2
    - Ensure SSH is enabled in Advanced Options
8) Run ~/RetroPie-Setup/retropie-setup.sh
    - Update the setup script
    - Run the binary based installation
    - Setup joypad
